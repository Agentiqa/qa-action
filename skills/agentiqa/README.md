# Agentiqa agent skill

A user-facing [agent skill](https://docs.agentiqa.com/docs/agent-skill) that teaches
an AI coding agent (Claude Code and compatible agents) how to drive
[Agentiqa](https://agentiqa.com) — the AI QA agent for web apps — across all four
surfaces: the CLI, the web app, the desktop app, and the GitHub Action.

Progressive disclosure: a compact `SKILL.md` with the essentials, bundled
`references/` files (CLI, service keys, JSON envelope, exit codes, quickstarts,
GitHub Action), and a delegation to `https://docs.agentiqa.com/llms-full.txt` for
anything unbundled.

## Install (Claude Code)

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Agentiqa/qa-action /tmp/qa-action
cp -R /tmp/qa-action/skills/agentiqa ~/.claude/skills/agentiqa
```

The agent loads it on demand when you ask to test an app with Agentiqa, run
`agentiqa` in CI, or parse an Agentiqa result.
